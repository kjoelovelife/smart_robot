## Introduction

This repository contains all the software that runs on the Smart robot , makerlab design.

* makerlab : https://www.makerlab.tw/

Smart robot is a low-cost platform base on raspberry pi 3, comes with rpi3 official camera , ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array , ultrasonic and also a Omini wheels driver. 

Microcontroller on Motor-controller is STM32F103RCT6 , with sensor MPU-9250 . 

The system is use Raspbian , Download image from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ . 

If you buy " Smart robot "ã€€from IcShop ( https://www.icshop.com.tw/product_info.php/products_id/27051 ) , will contain the " Raspbian " system and can use ROS . The password is our telephone number " 5564686 ".

# Usage & Tutorial on PI

## The  Startup sequence of the smart robort

* Step 1. Start the motor-controller   

* Step 2. Start Raspberry pi    

## creat environment for using smart_robot 

* Step 1. install Dependencies

Open the terminal on PI , then change directory to " smart_robot " ,then source " dependencies_for_smartRobot_pi_ws_tools.sh "

` cd ~/smart_roboot && source  dependencies_for_smartRobot_pi_ws_tools.sh `

* Step 2. build work space

` cd ~/smart_roboot/catkin_ws && catkin_make `

## move the smart_robot

* Step 1. Running ROS across multiple machines

If you don't understand how to use it , you can visit these website : 

For Mandarin chinese : https://www.makerlab.tw/blog/_ros2

For Emglish          : https://www.intorobotics.com/how-to-setup-ros-kinetic-to-communicate-between-raspberry-pi-3-and-a-remote-linux-pc/

And In this example , we use laptop to be the Master. 

* Step 2. Run Master on laptop

Open the terminal on laptop , and enter 

` roscore `

* Step 3. Run node " smart_robot_teleop_key.py " on laptop

` rosrun driver smart_robot_teleop_key.py	`

* Step 4. Run node " smart_robot_teleop_key.py " on raspberry pi 

` rosrun driver smart_robot_twist.py `

After you finish Step 4 , then you can use keyboard on laptop to control the smart robot , remember and check you are use the terminal of smart_robot_teleop_key.py , and it will show you how to use.   

## use speech recognition to control smart robot

* Step 1. Running ROS across multiple machines

More information can read step 1 in " moving the smart_robot "

* Step 2. Run Master on laptop

Open the terminal on laptop , and enter 

` roscore `
